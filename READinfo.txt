TITANS Foundation - Web Development Internship

 As mentioned in our project section, I've add all that sections i.e 
 
 1) Home page (With a slider showing latest courses)
 2) Course-detail page (Including user ratings)
 3) User-register & login page (For new users)
 4) About page (Details about the website company here you can keep dummy data)
 5) Cart page (Courses added to cart)
 6)Checkout page (Keep a checkout button for submitting order and provide a pop-up
   as ‘Order confirmed !’ to display then redirect to home page)

 I've also added some extra section like Map.
